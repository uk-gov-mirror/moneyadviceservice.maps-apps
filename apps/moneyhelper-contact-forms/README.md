## About

MoneyHelper Contact Forms is part of the [maps-apps monorepo](https://github.com/moneyadviceservice/maps-apps), which contains multiple applications for the Money and Pensions Service. This app provides a web interface allowing users to:

- Access and submit contact/enquiry forms for different MoneyHelper services
- Navigate the service in English or Welsh
- Experience a multi-step, accessible, and responsive form journey

The application is built with [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/), managed with [Nx](https://nx.dev/), and deployed using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

**This app leverages the [MoneyHelper Forms (MHF) shared library](../../libs/shared/mhf/)**, which provides reusable store logic, guards, validation helpers, and form components used across all MoneyHelper form applications in the monorepo.

## Shared Library (MHF)

This app is built on top of the **[MoneyHelper Forms (`libs/shared/mhf`) shared library](../../libs/shared/mhf/)**, which provides reusable store logic, guards, validation helpers, form components, and utilities for all MoneyHelper form applications.

**See the [MHF README](../../libs/shared/mhf/README.md) for complete details on what the library provides.**

**How this app extends the MHF library:**

This Contact Forms app extends the base `flowConfigValue` interface from MHF to add contact-specific properties:

```typescript
import { flowConfigValue } from '@maps-react/mhf/types';

export interface ContactflowConfigValue extends flowConfigValue {
  showBookingReferenceField?: boolean; // Contact Forms specific
  phoneNumberRequired?: boolean; // Contact Forms specific
  autoAdvanceStep?: StepName; // Contact Forms specific
}
```

This pattern allows the app to leverage shared logic while adding flow-specific behavior without modifying the base library.

---

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (see [.nvmrc](../../.nvmrc) in the repo for the required version)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v10 or later)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Nx CLI](https://nx.dev/getting-started/intro) (recommended for monorepo management)

  ```bash
  npm install -g nx@latest
  ```

---

## Getting started

1. **Clone the monorepo:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/moneyadviceservice/maps-apps.git
   cd maps-apps
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   > **Note:** All required environment variables are already configured in the Netlify dashboard for this project.

   **Recommended:**
   Simply link your local project to the correct Netlify site by running the following command and selecting the app from the dropdown:

   ```bash
   netlify link
   ```

   **If you do NOT have access to Netlify:**
   Declare the variables locally using the keys in [.env.example](./.env.example).

   Create `apps/moneyhelper-contact-forms/.env.local` (source of truth for this app) by copying `.env.example` and filling values:

   ```bash
   cp apps/moneyhelper-contact-forms/.env.example apps/moneyhelper-contact-forms/.env.local
   ```

   Update the variables with their values obtained from a peer developer or environment owner:

4. **Run the development server:**

   Since this app uses Netlify Functions, use the `serve-netlify` Nx target to run the app locally.

   **Recommended (Nx Console):**

   - Open Nx Console in VS Code
   - Select project `moneyhelper-contact-forms`
   - Run target `serve-netlify`

   **CLI equivalent:**

   ```bash
   npx nx run moneyhelper-contact-forms:serve-netlify
   ```

   This runs `netlify dev --filter moneyhelper-contact-forms` via `project.json` and uses `netlify.toml` for local app env loading.

   This uses the configuration in `netlify.toml` and ensures your Netlify Functions and environment are available locally.

   The app will be available at [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888).

## Environment Variables

The app requires several environment variables for API access and configuration, including those needed for the shared Redis instance.  
**These are already set up in the Netlify dashboard for this project.**  
**See [`libs/shared/redis/README.MD`](../../libs/shared/redis/README.MD) for full details.**

| Variable                             | Description                     |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADOBE_ANALYTICS_SCRIPT` | Adobe Script                    |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CIVIC_COOKIE_SCRIPT`    | Civic Cookie Control script URL |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CIVIC_COOKIE_API_KEY`   | Civic Cookie Control API key    |
| `REDIS_API_URL`                      | Redis cache API endpoint        |
| `REDIS_API_KEY`                      | Redis cache API key             |
| `API_URL`                            | Azure Function endpoint         |
| `API_CODE`                           | Azure Function endpoint code    |
| `COOKIE_NAME`                        | Session cookie name             |

You do **not** need to set these manually unless you are running outside of Netlify or need to override them for local testing.

## Branch and Backend Environment Mapping

The `API_URL` and `API_CODE` variables are used to connect this application to different Azure Function endpoints.  
**Netlify branches have been set up to enable different environment variables for each branch, allowing the frontend to target the correct backend environment.**

- Each branch in Netlify (e.g. `dev-gsi`, `qa-gsi`, `uat-gsi`) is mapped to a specific Azure Function endpoint.
- The backend team has configured the Azure Function URLs to match the corresponding frontend branch, ensuring seamless integration.
- When you push to a branch, Netlify automatically uses the correct `API_URL` and `API_CODE` for that environment.

For full details and a mapping table, see:  
[Environment Mapping D365 (BAU-GSI) to Netlify](<https://dev.azure.com/moneyandpensionsservice/MaPS%20Digital/_wiki/wikis/MaPS-Digital.wiki/1171/Environment-Mapping-D365-(BAU-GSI)-to-Netlify>)

**Adding Branches / Environments**

If further branches are required, they should be added to Netlify and configured with the appropriate environment variables for `API_URL` and `API_CODE` to ensure the frontend connects to the correct Azure Function endpoint.

For each new branch, coordinate with the backend team to confirm the endpoint mapping and set any additional required variables in the Netlify dashboard.

### Architecture and Approach

This app leverages the dynamic steps array and flow configuration pattern provided by the [MoneyHelper Forms Shared Library (MHF)](../../libs/shared/mhf/README.md#dynamic-steps-array--flow-construction).
All journey logic, branching, and step management are handled using the shared library’s utilities and store helpers.

For a full explanation of the architecture, flow pattern, and store update logic, see the [MHF README](../../libs/shared/mhf/README.md).

#### App-specific Implementation

- [`flowConfig.ts`](./routes/flowConfig.ts): Defines all flow sequences and junctions for Contact Forms
- [`netlify/functions/form-handler.mts`](./netlify/functions/form-handler.mts): Handles form submission, junction detection, and step rebasing
- [`lib/types/index.ts`](./lib/types/index.ts): Extends the shared flow config types for contact-specific properties
- [`routes/routeConfig.ts`](./routes/routeConfig.ts): Maps steps to components and guards
- [`routes/routeSchemas.ts`](./routes/routeSchemas.ts): Zod validation schemas
- [`guards/autoAdvanceGuard.ts`](./guards/autoAdvanceGuard.ts): Deep-linking and auto-advance implementation

See the [MHF README](../../libs/shared/mhf/README.md) for details on the shared architecture and flow pattern.
