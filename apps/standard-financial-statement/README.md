## Known issues and workarounds

### Form validation not working when submitting "apply to use the SFS" form locally

This can be resolved by running the app using the Netlify CLI instead of the usual method (Nx task):

1. Add the following configuration block to the SFS app's `netlify.toml`:

```
[context.dev.environment]
    STORE_NAME = "<value from .env.local>"
```

Be sure to replace `<value from .env.local>` with the appropriate value from the `.env.local` file within the SFS app directory (ask a team member for the specific environment variable value if you don't have it already). This step is necessary to work around the Netlify CLI not properly picking up the value from the `.env.local` file itself.

2. Run `npx Netlify dev`. This can be done from the SFS app directory, or from the monorepo root. The latter approach requires selecting `standard-financial-statement` from the options presented.
