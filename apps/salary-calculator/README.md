# Salary Calculator

A comprehensive salary calculation tool that helps users understand their net income, tax deductions, and take-home pay based on their gross salary.

## Credits

This project uses helper functions for income tax and national insurance calculations
originally developed in the [HMRC Income Tax Saving Tool](https://github.com/mcas.ms/SavingTool/hmrc-income-tax) repository.
We have integrated these functions directly into our codebase rather than calling an external API.
