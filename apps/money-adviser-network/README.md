## Authentication and Session management

The authentication only requires a valid referral ID. On success a session will be created which is handled within the NextJS app entierly.

There are 2 env variables that establish the session. Firstly, the session length itself:

- SESSION_EXPIRY_TIME: This is responsible for allowing the user access to the application. If it does not exist, or on expiry, the user will be redirected to the login screen.
- SESSION_REFRESH_TIME: This is responsible for maintianing the session validity whilst the user is active. It must be less time than the SESSION_EXPIRY_TIME to work.

The session functionality is handled and explained fully in `proxy.ts`. Please refer to this for a detailed explanation.
