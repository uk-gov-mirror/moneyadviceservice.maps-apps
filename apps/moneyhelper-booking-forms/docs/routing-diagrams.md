# Booking Forms Routing Diagrams

This page documents the route flow in smaller Mermaid sections so larger journeys stay readable.

Notation used in diagrams: `[step]` = page/step, `{decision}` = branching decision.

Design reference: [Figma - GSI journey map](https://www.figma.com/design/n07aj0G4F2HaaNiyXLggtq/GSI?node-id=1754-52193&p=f&m=dev)

## Previewing diagrams

- GitHub supports Mermaid in Markdown and renders these diagrams.
- Azure DevOps does not consistently render Mermaid in Markdown, so it may show raw code blocks.
- For now, preview diagrams locally in VS Code using Markdown Preview with a Mermaid extension.
- Suggested extension: `MermaidChart.vscode-mermaid-chart` (Mermaid).

## Source of truth

Routing behaviour is defined by these files:

- [flowConfig.ts](../routes/flowConfig.ts)
- [routeConfig.ts](../routes/routeConfig.ts)

## Appointment Section

This section shows how users branch from `appointment-type` into the three booking journeys.

```mermaid
%%{init: {"flowchart": {"curve": "stepAfter"}}}%%
flowchart LR
  A{appointment-type}

  A --> C[pension-wise-appointment]
  A --> D[self-employed-appointment]
  A --> E[divorce-appointment]
```

## Eligibility Section

This section shows the eligibility logic used after appointment selection, including pass/fail outcomes for each route.

### Pension Wise

```mermaid
%%{init: {"flowchart": {"curve": "stepBefore"}}}%%
flowchart LR
  A{eligibility-defined-contribution}

  A --> D{eligibility-over-50}
  A --> E[pension-wise-not-eligible]

  D --> F{eligibility-uk-pensions}
  D --> G{eligibility-age-exceptions}

  F --> H[[Access needs]]
  F --> E[pension-wise-not-eligible]

  G --> F{eligibility-uk-pensions}
  G --> E[pension-wise-not-eligible]
```

### Self-employed

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A[eligibility-business-state]
  A --> B[self-employed-pre-appointment]
```

### Divorce

```mermaid
%%{init: {"flowchart": {"curve": "stepBefore"}}}%%
flowchart LR
